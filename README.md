# Eventbrite Search Test

Before working on my second Capstone I wanted to practice using some APIs. This project uses [Eventbrite API](https://www.eventbrite.com/developer/v3/endpoints/events/) to find some events near a location, [Google Maps API](https://cloud.google.com/maps-platform/) to get location data, and [Google Calendar](https://developers.google.com/calendar/) to add events to your calendar.
